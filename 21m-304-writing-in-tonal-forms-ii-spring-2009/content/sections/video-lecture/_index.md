During the spring of 2009, a typical session of 21M.304 was recorded especially for OpenCourseWare. In the first part of the session, three students present their analysis of a short piano work, followed by class discussion. The last segment of class is a workshop format where students present their own compositions and receive feedback. Many of the work-in-progress scores can be found in the Assignments section.
